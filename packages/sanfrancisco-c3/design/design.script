drshelley: Hello.

## MainQuestions

* I was sent here from Retronator. -> [Retronator] `not Retronator`
* How do I create a character? -> [Create] `not Create`
* I'm so sorry, but could you repeat how to create characters? -> [CreateAgain] `Create`
* Can you tell me about the cyborgs? -> [Cyborgs]
* Thank you for your time. -> [EndDialog]

## Retronator

drshelley: Ugh, another gamer.

> The doctor doesn't look pleased with you, but stops from making further comment.

-> [MainQuestions]

## Cyborgs

drshelley: What would you like to know?

## CyborgQuestions

* What is it exactly? -> [MakeCyborgs]
* How does Neurasync work with this? -> [Neurasync] `MakeCyborgs`
* And how do you give AI to it? -> [AI] `MakeCyborgs`
* How will I control the Avatar/Agent hybrid? -> [Control] `MakeCyborgs`
* Thanks for the information. -> [EndDialog]

## MakeCyborgs

drshelley:
    A cyborg is any human with robotic parts. Here at C3 we produce all parts a human might need: prosthetic limbs, internal organs, vision and hearing replacements.
    Our latest advancement is a full prosthetic body, an Avatar. 
    The brain is the only part necessary, but even that can be taken further with Neurasync BCI, or replaced altogether with StrongAI to make an Agent.

-> [CyborgQuestions]

## Neurasync

drshelley:
    With Neurasync's technology, the brain doesn't need to be directly installed in the cybernetic body. 
    The pilot is connected remotely and their brain output kept in sync with the inputs of the Avatar's artificial neurons.

-> [CyborgQuestions]

## AI

drshelley:
    A massively-parallel multithreaded processor installed in an Avatar converts it into an AI agent.
    We use StrongAI's machine learning algorithms on data collected with Neurasync from real people, creating a library of behaviors that are inherently human.
    Our Agents were the first to break the Total Turing test earlier this year.

-> [CyborgQuestions]

## Control

drshelley:
    After you've designed the Avatar, we will use your SYNC device to read off your unique behavior signature.
    This will create a symbiotic connection between yourself and the synthetic brain created by StrongAI. 
    The Agent will essentially run on a copy of your brain's activity, possessing most of your strengths and weaknesses.
    The similarity allows for the Agent to be very susceptible to your commands. You will become their inner voice.

-> [CyborgQuestions]

## Create

-> [CreateMain] `Retronator`
 
drshelley: A character? You must be one of those gamers, only they call them that.

-> [CreateMain]

## CreateAgain

> Dr. Shelley looks at you with her eyebrows raised, but eventually gives in.

drshelley: Pay attention this time.

-> [CreateSteps]

## CreateMain

drshelley: I'll put it in simple terms for you.

## CreateSteps

drshelley:
    1. Use this terminal to design the visual features. If you have any trouble, complain to the UX department, not to me.
    2. Go east to Behavior Setup. The terminal there will sync with your brain (if there's anything in there) and you can adjust any situational aspects of your â€¦ 'character'.
    3. Continue further east to the Stasis Chamber. That's where Avatars wait for deployment. Activate it with your SYNC device and our field team will deliver it to Retronator. 

* OK, keep going east and do something in each room, got it.

drshelley: Aren't you a smart cookie.

> The doctor turns back to her computer and resumes working.

## EndDialog

> The doctor nods and gets back to her work.

-> [End]

## MakingOfACyborg

> You raise from the workstation and head out to the platform that overlooks the assembly line. 
> You stare into the vast hall. The machines work tirelessly to create parts for new, more sophisticated machines. It's a cycle of a new kind of life.
> You can now continue east to Behavior Setup to finish your character.

-> [End]
