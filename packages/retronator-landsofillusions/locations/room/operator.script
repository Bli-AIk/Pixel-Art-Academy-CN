### WaitToSeat

> You sit down and relax into the softness of the recliner.

operator: Awesome. Let me set things up.

> Panzer pulls the headset towards your head and you look into the visor. 
> Everything is black but for a small rotating cube in the center.

operator: I'm turning on the sound and haptic system. 

> The chair switches into a reclining position and a clear sound rushes through the surround system.
> You cannot help but feel the shivers travel down your spine as dopamine floods your brain.
> The ambient sounds from the HQ have turned into complete silence and you now hear Panzer's voice as if he was directly in your head.

operator: 
    All set. I'll monitor your immersion from my control station at the reception.
    If you need anything, all you have to do is _talk to operator_.

> Panzer opens the door and goes west.
