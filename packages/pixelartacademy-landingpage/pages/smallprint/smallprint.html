    <p>By using our webpages and services (in the future 'service') you agree to the Terms of Service and the Privacy
      Policy. 'We' and 'our' refers to Retronator, 'you', 'yours', and 'user' refers to you as the user of our service.</p>

    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

    <h3>Availability</h3>
    <p>There is no guarantee for maintaining our service. Downtimes are likely and sometimes necessary (for example when
      updating the servers).</p>
    <p>Service can be discontinued if Retronator isn't able to sustain development and operation.
      However, most of the projects are <a href="https://github.com/retronator" target="_blank">open source</a>
      and can be taken over by the community.</p>

    <h3>User data</h3>
    <p>Saving your game through the game menus or creating an account through the game storyline creates a user account.</p>
    <p>There is no guarantee for maintaining user data (e.g. user account information, game states, game characters).
      Daily backups of the database are being created, but in the unlikely event that all data is lost, we are not
      liable for this loss.</p>
    <p>Further details regarding user data are explained in the Privacy Policy below.</p>

    <h3>User generated content</h3>
    <p>By entering any kind of content (e.g. images, text) into our service (in this section 'content'), you allow us to store the content
      and display it to other users of our service. You also allow us to include the content in screenshots or videos
      taken of the service with the intent of documenting and promoting the development of the service.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to remove content at our discretion. This is mainly to
      remove offensive and/or prohibited content.</p>
    <p>The current guidelines for prohibited content include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>abusive content, harassment, hate speech, and other content we determine as offensive to others,</li>
      <li>sexually explicit content such as pornography,</li>
      <li>content not owned by the user, unless it is made clear that it is not owned (or created) by the user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of the content that is allowed will be filtered in the future so that users can opt-out of seeing it.
      This content includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>sexual content such as nudity created with artistic or educational purpose,</li>
      <li>profanity and vulgar language,</li>
      <li>violence and other graphic imagery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Right now such filtering is not active and the use of filtering is not available to users.</p>
    <p>If a user references (mentions, addresses, indicates) other users or their works, and the user being referenced finds such content offensive, we will remove it on request.
      The goal for the future is to give automated tools to users to block other users and moderate content posted around their work.</p>
    <p>You are highly discouraged from posting negative opinions unless explicitly asked for (e.g. the author of a work requests a critique).</p>
    <p>Finally, we are not responsible for the legality of user generated content.</p>

    <h3>General content warning</h3>
    <p>Pixel Art Academy contains pixelated nudity and, like above, there are currently no ways to
      filter this content. Certain sections of the game will focus on human anatomy and will center around nudity.
      Other adult themes may be explored throughout the game.</p>
    <p>The goal for the future is to have a content warning system in place to inform users of such content.
      Currently no such system is in place.</p>

    <h3>Termination and refunds</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate service based on violations of these terms (in current and future versions of the terms).</p>
    <p>Some reasons for termination include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>repeated posting of prohibited content,</li>
      <li>repeated offenses towards other users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When a user account is terminated, a refund will be attempted to compensate for the services no longer
      available to the user. The value at which the service was purchased or the current price of the service,
      whichever is lower, will be made available to the user.</p>
    <p>The user can also proactively request a refund. The value refunded will be calculated as in the previous paragraph.</p>

    <h3>Age restriction</h3>
    <p>You need to be 13 years old or older to create a user account. Doing so stores personal information as discussed
      in the Privacy Policy below.</p>

    <h3>Liability</h3>
    <p>We are not liable for any damage caused by your use of the service. We protect your privacy and personal information
      to the best of our knowledge. By entering personal information into our system you agree to not hold as liable
      for third-party breaches or exposure of this information.</p>

    <h3>Amendments</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to amend our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Inevitably someone will do something stupid that we haven't though of and we'll have to become more strict
      regarding our operation.
      We will notify you of important policy changes (at our discretion), but it is your responsibility to read these documents
      and be aware of currently active terms.</p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h3>General security</h3>
    <p>User passwords are never collected in plain text. Only their hash form leaves your browser and gets stored on our servers.
      Authentication tokens (oAuth) are stored with encryption.</p>

    <h3>Payment information</h3>
    <p>No direct credit card information is stored on our servers. <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a>
      is the provider that collects that information directly from you (in the browser), and stores it independently of us.
      We receive and store a confirmation token that Stripe
      recognizes to perform purchases with your information. We also receive and store the email used for your purchase.</p>
    <p>To comply with European Union laws regarding selling of electronic services, we store your selected billing country,
      country of your payment method, and if these two don't match, also your IP address at the time of purchase, and
      the country detected based on your IP address.</p>
    <p>We relay your credit card information to you from Stripe when explicitly requested (e.g. when viewing saved payment methods).
      The server immediately discards this information after it sends it to you.</p>
    <p>Kickstarter backers information is stored on the server for people that pledged through Kickstarter. This is used to provide
      backers with correct game rewards.</p>
    <p>All transactions (e.g. purchases, pledges) are documented and are included in various displays. Users appear
      anonymously unless otherwise requested by the user.</p>

    <h3>Personal information</h3>
    <p>No storage of personally identifiable information is performed when you access our free and public services,
      unless you specifically allow it.</p>
    <p>Some of our services require creation of a user account. Email or other authentication data (e.g. Twitter username)
      is collected with your permission and stored to enable this, along with default public information these services
      provide upon login (e.g. name, gender, locale, profile picture).</p>
    <p>If you make any purchases or pledges (through our websites or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/retro" target="_blank">Patreon</a>),
      the information of the purchase (date and amount) is made available through our public accounting documents and other financial displays
      (e.g. supporters display in the Retronator Store game location). All users are anonymous by default, but you can
      provide a name to be displayed if you wish so.</p>
    <p>All other personal data you provide is done under your discretion and responsibility. The characters you create
      are assumed to be representations of fictional people. Any correlation between your characters and yourself is
      created voluntarily.</p>
    <p>You can request to download your data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:hi@retronator.com">hi@retronator.com</a>.</p>
    <p>No personal information for people under 13 is knowingly stored as per the terms of service.</p>

    <h3>User tracking and gameplay information</h3>
    <p>If you consent to it, we use browser local storage to
      save gameplay information (e.g. current player location, selected character, game state for users without a save
      game). That information is stored on your computer and is not tracked across domains. You can always revoke your
      consent in the Permissions section of the Settings, accessed through the main game menu.</p>
    <p>After you've created a user account, gameplay state is stored in our database instead of your local storage.</p>

    <h3>User data deletion and data retention periods</h3>
    <p>If you want your user account, created characters, or any related data deleted, write to
      <a href="mailto:hi@retronator.com">hi@retronator.com</a> and we will remove it as soon as possible. This should generally be within a week.</p>
    <p>Once deleted, the data will not show up on any of our services.</p>
    <p>To prevent complete loss of data in an event of server failure, we do maintain backups of the database. Removing
    individual data entries from backups is not within our means, so the data will remain in the backups, privately, until the backups are removed.
    We keep database backups for up to two years.</p>

    <h2>Copyright notice</h2>
    <p>Most Retronator projects are open source. The source code and content created in their development is made
      available under open source and creative commons licenses, as indicated in individual project repositories. By providing any
      kind of help to the development of these projects (e.g. writing source code, contributing art
      that is used to present the game itself), you are releasing your contributions under those licenses.</p>
    <p>This does not apply to content you are creating by using our service (i.e. user generated content such as
      writing in the game journal or uploading your artworks). In this case you only allow us to display your content
      to other users as described in the Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>In neither case do we claim any copyright to your content. You are only licensing the use of it.</p>
    <p>We display other copyrighted works for educational purpose. We do this under fair use,
      however, it is not our desire to display works of authors that do not want to be included in our
      projects. If you want any of your works removed, write to
      <a href="mailto:hi@retronator.com">hi@retronator.com</a> and we will remove it as soon as possible.</p>
