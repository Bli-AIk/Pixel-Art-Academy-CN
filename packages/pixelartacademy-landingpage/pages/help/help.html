    ## Basics

    You can get by with just a handful of commands.

    <dl>
      <dt>Look at <span class="avatar">something</span></dt>
      <dd>Get a description of something you see in the scene.</dd>

      <dt>Use <span class="avatar">item</span></dt>
      <dd>Perform an action with the item.</dd>

      <dt>Get <span class="avatar">item</span></dt>
      <dd>Add an item to your inventory.</dd>

      <dt>Talk to <span class="avatar">Person</span></dt>
      <dd>Start a conversation with a person.</dd>

      <dt>N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW</dt>
      <dd>Move to the location at that cardinal direction.</dd>

      <dt>In, Out, Up, Down</dt>
      <dd>Additional navigational directions.</dd>
    </dl>

    You can also just type the name of an item and the interface
    will show you a list of possible commands you can perform with it.

    ## Useful commands

    <dl>
      <dt>Look</dt><dd>Displays the location description again (clears command history).</dd>
      <dt>Map</dt><dd>Displays the map.</dd>
      <dt>Help</dt><dd>You're reading it right now.</dd>
    </dl>

    ## Keyboard shortcuts

    <dl>
      <dt>Escape</dt><dd>Back/open menu.</dd>
      <dt>Tab</dt><dd>Open map/SYNC.</dd>
      <dt>Alt</dt><dd>Open PixelBoy.</dd>
      <dt>Up/Down</dt><dd>See previously typed commands.</dd>
    </dl>

    ## Multiplayer commands

    When interacting with other players, you have to know some extra commands.

    <dl>
      <dt>Listen</dt>
      <dd>Enter the conversation people are having at a location.</dd>

      <dt>Listen to <span class="avatar">Person</span></dt>
      <dd>Enter a conversation a specific person is having, if their description says they are talking.</dd>

      <dt>Say <span class="text">Something.</span></dt>
      <dd>
        Start a new conversation or reply to a conversation that is currently taking place.
        You can omit SAY and just type your reply in quotes.
      </dd>

      <dt>Back, Look</dt>
      <dd>Exit the conversation.</dd>

      <dt>Back, Exit memory</dt>
      <dd>Exit a memory (when using SYNC).</dd>

      <dt>Talk to <span class="avatar">Person</span></dt>
      <dd>
        Initiate a scripted dialogue with other players' characters. That way you can ask them to hang out,
        after which they will appear in the Café whenever they've done something new in the game. Use the "What's
        new?" dialog option to find out what it was.
      </dd>

      <dt>Hang out</dt>
      <dd>When you're in the Café, you can hang out with PCs you've invited previously.</dd>
    </dl>

    ## Full vocabulary

    Unlike some old-school text adventures, the point of Pixel Art Academy is not in guessing the right text commands.
    The text interface is merely a way to get things done until the game gets fully illustrated and point-and-click
    interface can be applied for navigating the world as well.

    That's why most everything can be done simply with <span class="command">use</span> and
    <span class="command">talk to</span> commands. However, there are occasional extra commands that need to be used to
    proceed (like <span class="command">sit</span> or <span class="command">wake up</span>), and many others that are
    simply there to make the range of verbs you can use more natural.

    Here they are listed all.
