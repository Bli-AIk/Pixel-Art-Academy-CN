              The idea that started it all, play an adventure game and travel to the island of Retropolis where you will
              develop your skills as an art student.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a highly ambitious project, 7 years in the making with many more to come to realize the full
              vision. Currently, the first chapter—Admission Week—is available as an open alpha to anyone who pre-orders
              the game. It is played directly in the browser through a text interface, with ambitions to become a
              point-and-click adventure one day.

              Purchasing Adventure Mode happens in-game as part of the gameplay. It costs $10–$40 and will include a
              Steam key for Learn Mode as well (upon release or immediately if you choose Alpha Access).

              In Learn Mode, you jump straight into Pixel Art Academy's interactive tutorials for the fastest way of
              becoming a pixel artist. Put theory into practice with drawing challenges and unleash your creativity on
              projects where you make art for video games.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given how long the full development of Adventure Mode will take, I wanted to take the already finished
              learning parts and offer them as a standalone, downloadable game. Learn Mode enables me to create more
              educational content quickly and will be the first to get new updates before they are eventually integrated
              into Adventure Mode.

              You will also get Learn Mode when purchasing Adventure Mode so consider if that option works better for you
              than purchasing directly on Steam.

            I believe education should be freely available to everyone so I am committed to releasing all learning content developed for Pixel Art Academy as open educational resources.

          <p>
            The Retropolis Academy of Art Study Guide provides free written articles on the topics covered by the game. If you aren't able to purchase the game, that shouldn't be a barrier to learning.

        <h2 class="title">Development story</h2>
        <p>
          The idea for a pixel art game about learning pixel art started in 2015 as I was applying to the Learning,
          Design, and Technology Master's degree at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Following a successful
          Kickstarter, I graduated with the project's design in 2016 and started full-time development.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my research, I realized it's not just access to learning materials that is holding people back from
          realizing their aspirations. Especially for adults, committing and following through is hard when our time
          competes with other forms of entertainment and life's challenges. My thesis was that if we become invested in
          our learning as easily as we do with other video games, this would help people improve their skills without
          much effort. I set out to develop a rich world where you create your character and acquire skills as well as
          learn how to learn.

        <p>
          However, this proved to be a monumental task as a mostly solo developer. I had to learn a lot myself about how
          to focus the production while also navigating a part-time job running a physical school for game development.
          Even though the game had many alpha releases along the way and the players could see the potential, the full
          vision was too far away for sustainable development.
        </p>
        <p>
          7 years into development, I took a step back to see how things could have been done better if I had the chance
          to do it all over again. I concluded that I should have developed the free learning materials first, the
          interactive tutorials second, and the story-rich world around it last. While I couldn't rewind time, I did
          change course there and then. The game was split into the free Study Guide, the focused Learn Mode, and the
          overarching Adventure Mode.

          After 1 and a half years of working on the standalone, downloadable version of Pixel Art Academy, Learn Mode is
          ready to enter Early Access on Steam. It took many turns to get here but I did my best with the knowledge I
          had at the time, and most importantly I never gave up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many ways, the Early Access release of Learn Mode is just the start. The development continues with adding
          new content for the full release, covering all pixel art fundamentals and the 7 elements of art. I'm sure it
          will take a couple of more wrong turns to get there, but hopefully all the right ones too.

        <h3>Friends I made along the way</h3>
        <p>
          While almost everything in the game is designed, drawn, and coded by me, the game would not be as great if I
          didn't have help along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original soundtrack for the game is being composed by
          <a class="friend" href="https://annaeichenauermusic.com" target="_blank">Anna Eicheneur</a>.
          The title/Kickstarter theme was done by
          <a class="friend" href="https://c-jeff.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">C-jeff</a>.
          Some more friends donated their old music albums.
          <a class="friend" href="https://x.com/SarahBurrough" target="_blank">Burra</a> helped with outreach in the
          early days, as did
          <a class="friend" href="http://objectsforheads.com" target="_blank">objectsforheads</a> with coding. Many of my
          friends at
          <a class="friend" href="https://www.spelkollektivet.com" target="_blank">Spelkollektivet</a> and others helped
          playtest the game. I use open-source libraries and frameworks as well as Creative Commons music and references.
          The game features many artists and video games without whose inspiration I wouldn't be writing this today.
        </p>
        <p>
          A big thank you to everyone who contributed to the game in any way, and to you, reading this now. I encourage
          you to check the full credits in the game itself.
