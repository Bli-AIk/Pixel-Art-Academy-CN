# Retronator 

## Accounts

Retronator Accounts is a Meteor package that works with Meteor user accounts and creates a unified user system for all Retronator projects (starting with Pixel Art Academy).

It uses packages [Meteor Link Accounts](https://github.com/yubozhao/meteor-link-accounts/) and [Meteor Accounts Meld](https://github.com/splendido/meteor-accounts-meld) to manage different login services associated with the same user. 
Due to these packages not being actively maintained, they have been merged into the project and prefixed with `retronator:` to avoid conflicts.
