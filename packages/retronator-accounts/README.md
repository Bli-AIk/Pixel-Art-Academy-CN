# Retronator Accounts

Retronator Accounts is a Meteor package that works with Meteor user accounts and creates a unified user system for all Retronator projects (starting with Pixel Art Academy).

It uses packages [Meteor Link Accounts](https://github.com/yubozhao/meteor-link-accounts/) and [Meteor Accounts Meld](https://github.com/splendido/meteor-accounts-meld) to manage different login services associated with the same user.

One main feature of the package is support for transactions, including Kickstarter pledges, online store purchases, and reward fulfillment.
