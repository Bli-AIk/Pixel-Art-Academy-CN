# Artificial Engines

A Meteor game development library written in CoffeeScript.

### Artificial Babel

_Translation framework_

Database-based translation framework for easy, reactive translating.

### Artificial Base

_The app framework_

Tying all the pieces of your app together can be a hassle. Running an update and draw loop should be unified. 
Artificial Base (AB) gives you the basic framework.

### Artificial Control

_Input hardware abstraction_

Helpers for keyboard, mouse and other input devices.

### Artificial Echo

_Acoustic waves simulation_

Helpers for web audio.

### Artificial Everywhere

_Useful bits and pieces_

Some static classes and routines are just useful right about everywhere in your code and donâ€™t fall into any specific
category. The place for them is Artificial Everywhere (AE).

### Artificial Mirage

_Graphical user interface elements_

A great GUI is a ticket to user friendliness. Artificial Mirage provides common interface elements that you connect
into a system, specially designed to adapt to different display resolutions and aspect ratios.

### Artificial Mummification

_Data storage_

Classes, extensions and helpers for database storage.

### Artificial Pyramid

_Geometry and calculus_

There is no programming without mathematics but while common algebra is usually as far as it goes in writing algorithms,
computer games and simulations require quite a load of geometric calculations and integration. Artificial Pyramid 
provides classes that extend javascript math functions with calculations that appear when developing a game.

### Artificial Reality

_Laws of physics_

To simulate real life, we need to act in accordance to laws of physics. Artificial Reality provides these, as well as 
integration of the Bullet physics engine (via Ammo.js) for simulation of classical mechanics.

### Artificial Spectrum

_Rendering routines_

Artificial Spectrum provides powerful supportive objects with rich functionality for many different rendering tasks
one might require.

### Artificial Telepathy

_Network communication_
