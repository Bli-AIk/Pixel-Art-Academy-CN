          The Study Guide from <a href="{{routerPath 'Retropolis.City.Pages.AcademyOfArt.Academy'}}">Retropolis Academy of Art</a>
          follows the same art curriculum used at the Academy campus, now freely
          accessible from anywhere in the Solar System.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Guide incorporates other online learning materials and provides practical activities
          that cover a wide range of art creation and game development topics. It is a work in progress with
          more volumes and activities on the way.
