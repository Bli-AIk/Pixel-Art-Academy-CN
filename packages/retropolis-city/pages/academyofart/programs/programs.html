          Learn to draw, your way
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our curriculum is designed around four levels of art making: Artwork, Process, Progress, and Personal.
        </p>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          We're not here to just pass on the theory (Artwork) or the how-to (Process). We center on you, what you want
          to draw, and we build a learning experience around that (Progress). We also ask you why, and help you navigate the
          many ups and downs on the road of being an artist (Personal).
        </p>
        <h2>No grades, no exams</h2>
        <p>
          There is no extrinsic motivation built into the system. If you don't want to learn how to draw, by all
          means go pursuit something else, ideally what your heart desires.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the academy, you learn for yourself, not for grades. There are no standards to uphold, no certificates
          given. You answer to no-one, not even your peers or fans of your work. Your art is your own business.
          All the systems we put in place are there to support your wish to draw better. We want you to do it as
          efficiently as possible, and get the most enjoyment out of it.
          Learning to draw is intrinsically rewarding when approached the right way.

            Grounded in learning theory
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our approach is based in research on self-directed and self-regulated learning, legitimate peripheral
            participation, situated learning, growth mindset, protége effect, psychology of flow, behavior design,
            backwards design, constructivism, and constructionism.
          </p>
          <p>
            What this means in practice is that your learning experience is treated as such—an experience, an adventure.
            We don't just serve you information, we create a holistic journey for you to acquire the skills you desire.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also do our own research. We measure the performance of our curriculum and do constant adjustments
            to advance the efficiency of our system.

          Our public presence is just getting started and the materials provided are
          in draft form. We're slowly making our learning curriculum available online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, our program to accept international students to learn on campus is still in preparation.

                The online course represents our commitment to make all the learning materials publicly available,
                for free, to everyone. If you can't come to Retropolis, this gives you access to our full course
                in online article form.

                You will have to administer the learning yourself, but
                it requires no commitment, no admission, and there are no expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The online course is presented through the Study Guide, published in Retronator Magazine. The main body of
                learning is contained in the Tome of Knowledge, with activities that take you through
                its materials in a similar fashion than our on-campus storylines. In fact, the activities in the Study Guide
                are the scripts by which our learning scenarios are designed in the first place.
