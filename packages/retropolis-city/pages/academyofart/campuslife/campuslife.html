          <h2>Welcome to a campus like no other</h2>
          <p>
            The Retropolis Academy of Art is a sprawling campus filled with many specialized art tracks and no centralized curriculum.
            Once you've completed orientation, you're free to choose your speciality. Explore the campus and learn what interests you most.

            You could learn everything we teach from the other side of the globe, but we want you to be as close to the
            community as possible. By having your own home away from home you'll be surrounded in the most stimulating
            environment for learning about art as soon as you step outside the door.

            You'll be given your own art studio when you join.

          <p>
            Other students also have studios on the campus. You'll be able to visit them and see how they're doing too.
            Remember to say hello! You're part of a community of artists now.

        <p>
          We take diversity seriously and welcome everyone that shares our common values outlined in the Retropolis Code of
          Behavior. Your classmates will be people of all ages, genders, backgrounds, and preferences; be prepered to respect

          Below are statistics for our incoming international students for 2017. Ideally the numbers
          would match the general world population, so we strive to come closer to that goal with
          outreach to underrepresented groups.

              Unlike traditional schools in which you would generally find young students, Academy of Art members are
              mostly 20â€“50 years old. It's never too late to learn to draw!

              Of those who identify with a particular gender, 20% are female. While this reflects the worldwide
              scene of pixel artists and game developers, we make it our duty to provide role models equally.
