                Congratulations on completing Admission Week!
              </p>
              <p>
                It is our great pleasure to offer you admission to Retropolis Academy of art. We know that you will bring
                something special to the vibrant life on campus and we welcome you with open arms.
              </p>
              <p>
                You and your classmates will be part of the very first generation of international students, coming to study
                on campus from abroad. We are still in preparations to accommodate your stay, so use this time to get
                ready for moving to Retropolis once we've got everything in place.
              </p>
              <p>
                No further action is needed at this timeâ€”we will contact you over email when it's time to arrange
                your flights to Retropolis. We look forward to hearing from you then and hope you do great in the
                mean time.
              </p>
