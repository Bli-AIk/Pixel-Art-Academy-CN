corinne: You got it!

> Corinne steps to the shelves and looks for the right game folder.

corinne: 
  I think it should be in here â€¦

corinne: 
  There you go. 
  Look in the Challenges section of the Drawing app.
  You can use the PixelBoy editor or your own software to complete the task.
  Whatever you use, that option will unlock for you for your admission project as well.
