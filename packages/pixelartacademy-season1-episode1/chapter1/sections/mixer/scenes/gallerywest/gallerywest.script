## MixerStart

shelley:
  Welcome everyone! 
  I hope your admission week is going great so far. 
  My name is Shelley and I'm the coordinator for your application process to the Academy.
  Now don't worry, that doesn't mean I'm deciding who gets admitted and who doesn't. That is really up to you.
  I'm here to help in any way I can to make sure you complete admission week.
  It's important to know you're not going through this process alone. Your time at the Academyâ€”and during Admission Weekâ€”will be shared with your classmates.
  Today you will join a study group. You and your groupmates will meet every day to see how you're progressing on your admission tasks.
  But first let's get to know each other a little better so you have an easier time choosing your partners.

> Everyone looks around each other, some more nervously than others, but all excited to get started.

## IceBreakersStart

`if (!answers) answers = {}`

shelley:
  Now, go to the middle of the room and make sure you have a marker at hand.
  
> Participants gather in the middle. 

### IceBreakersStart

shelley:
  I will ask a question and you will go to the left or right side of the room based on your answer. You can stay in the middle too.
  First, do you want drawing to be mainly your hobby or profession?
