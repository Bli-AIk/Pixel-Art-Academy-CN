# PixelArtAcademy.Season1.Episode1.Chapter1.CoordinatorAddress.MeetingSpace

## Start

coordinator: Alright, let's have a quick first meeting.

> Everyone sits down in a circle.

coordinator: 
  I know you got to know each other a bit already, but just to make sure we all know each other's names, let's do a round of introductions.
  You can just say your name and if you want a fun fact about yourself.
  Why don't we start with you, _npc1_.
  
npc1:
  Hi, my name is _npc1_ like _coordinator_ said. 
  I just graduated from UC Berkeley, so I'm looking for what to do next in life. Going to Retropolis seemed like a perfect choice since I don't want to get involved with the business side of making art. `_studyGroup.npc1.name is 'Ty'`
  I come from India, but my family moved to the US when I was a teenager. `_studyGroup.npc1.name is 'Saanvi'`
  I am a graphic designer. I did pixel art back in the 90s and I want to get back into it. `_studyGroup.npc1.name is 'Mae'`

<!-- Agents dynamic introductions -->
  
<!-- Player introduction -->

coordinator:
  And last we have â€¦
  
npc2:
  I'm _npc2_. `_studyGroup.npc2.name is 'Ace'`
  I'm _npc2_. `_studyGroup.npc2.name is 'Lisa'`
  I'm _npc2_. `_studyGroup.npc2.name is 'Jaxx'`
