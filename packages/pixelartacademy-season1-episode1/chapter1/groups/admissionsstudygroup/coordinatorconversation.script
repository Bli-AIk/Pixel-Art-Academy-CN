## Conditions

coordinator: 
  There are four main goals you need to complete, and you can do them in any order you want.
  One is to join a study group and get to know some of your future classmates.
  Another is to decide how much time you want to put into drawing per week and then fulfill that commitment.
  You'll have to design a study plan that will help you complete all the admission week tasks.
  Finally, your biggest goal is to complete an admission project and set a baseline for yourself, where your skills are at the moment.
